"""Name resolution services.

The motivation for using resolvers is the capability of flexible symbolic
linking between various components of the application (form specifications)
without the need to access the linked instances directly.  Instances of all
components are created transparently by the resolver in the moment of their
actual use.

class Resolver(object):

    The resolver is responsible for resolution of specification names.  It
    automatically creates specification instances from classes defined by
    specification modules.  It then calls methods on those instances and
    returns their results.  The specification instances as well as the results
    of their method calls are cached transparently.  The only public method is
    'get()' which returns the result of calling a given method on given
    specification (both given by name).

    The specifications are located by their name in python modules available in
    the current python path.  The resolver can be configured in two modes using
    the constructor argument `search'.  The names are either fully qualified
    names including the top level module name or relative to modules named in
    the search list (see the constructor documentation for more details).

    The configuration option `search_modules' is normally passed as the
    `search' constructor argument by pytis to the resolver instances which it
    creates.

           `Users' in python module `myapp' and its submodule `people'.  If
           `search' is used, it must be a sequence of strings.  These strings
           are used as prefixes to specification names passed to 'get()'.  Thus
           a name `people.Users' will be searched in pyhon modules `myapp' and
