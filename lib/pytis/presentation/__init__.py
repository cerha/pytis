"""Data transformations and presentation.

This module is intended to solve processing of data which does not belong to
the module 'pytis.data', is generally needed by user interfaces, but is not
specific for any particular user interface.  The typical functionality solved
by this module is computing the values of virtual fields, handling dynamic
changes of editability of input fields, their validation and integrity
checking, dynamic codebook filtering etc.
