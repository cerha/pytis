"""Sample web application based on Pytis CMS.

Pytis CMS is a fat client CMS form Pytis Extensions.  See 'defs/cms.py' for more information.

This is a sample Web application using Wiking and managed through Pytis CMS.

The Wiking modules based on Pytis CMS are defined in 'pytis.cms.web'.  They are imported
here so may be further customized here.  They also depend of a few Wiking modules, so these modules
are also imported here from Wiking.

To use this application, simply configure a Wiking site to search this module for available Wiking
Modules.  For example put this line into the site's configuration file:

modules = ('demo',)

Of course, you need to have the path to this module in the Python path of your web server and the
web server must be configured to run Wiking (see Wiking documentation for more information).
