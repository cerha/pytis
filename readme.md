Pytis framework
===============

Pytis is a tool for software developers which makes it possible to build
information systems declaratively by defining abstract specifications of
database views in Python and let the system do the rest.  Pytis automatically
manages data models in a relational database and creates user interfaces (forms
to work with the data) according to these abstract specifications.

Pytis currently implements:
* comprehensive PostgreSQL database support
* rich user interface based on wx Widgets (fully tested on wx/GTK)
* web interface with asynchronously loaded HTML forms
   
Pytis is a Free Software distributed under the terms of GNU General Public
License.

Pytis code is quite well documented, but unfortunately there's currently
nothing as a guide or tutorial allowing anyone to start using it productively
without reading the source code.
