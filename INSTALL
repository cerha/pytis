Pytis Installation Instructions

Requirements:

  * Python 2.3 or later
  * PostgreSQL 8.1 or later
  * python-psycopg2 library (for older versions - PyPgSQL Python library)
  * egenix-mx-datetime Python library
  * python-wxgtk2.6 or later (only for GUI apps)
  * python-imaging (only when using Image data types)  

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
"make all && make install" within the package root directory.  Feel free to
edit the Makefile and setup your own installation paths.

You can also run the development version directly out of your checked out tree,
being able to check out a newer version at any time and using this new version
right away.  The Makefile supports this setup by linking the necessary
directories into your checked out tree.  You need to run "make all && make
install-links" for the first time, and then just "make all" after each
checkout.
