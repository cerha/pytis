Pytis Installation Instructions

Requirements:

  * Python 2.3 or later
  * PostgreSQL 8.1 or later
  * python-psycopg2 library (for older versions - PyPgSQL Python library)
  * egenix-mx-datetime Python library
  * python-wxgtk2.6 or later (only for GUI apps)
  * python-imaging (only when using Image data types)  

The simplest installation can be done using the provided Makefile.  Just run
"make install" within the package root directory.  Feel free to edit the
Makefile and setup your own installation paths.

You can also setup Pytis manually.  This is recommended when you checked Pytis
out of CVS.  The two options described below will allow you to run the CVS
version directly.  You will be able to check out a newer version at any time
and this new version will be used automatically.

You need to add Pytis libraries somewhere to your Python path.  The recommended
approach is to link the library to your site packages directory.  On a
unix/linux system invoke the following commands from the package root
directory:

 $ ln -s `pwd`/lib/pytis /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/pytis

Replace `python2.4' with the Python version you use.

Alternatively, you may add Pytis to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

 $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/lib

You will probably want to set PYTHONPATH from within your shell startup file to
make it available permanently.
