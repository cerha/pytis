Pytis Installation Instructions

Requirements:

  * Python 2.3 or later
  * PostgreSQL 8.1 or later
  * python-wxgtk2.6 or later
  * egenix-mx-datetime Python library
  * PyPgSQL Python library

The following instructions assume, that you have downloaded Pytis and unpacked
it somewhere on your system.  We will refer to the unpacked directory as `the
installation directory'.  All the mentioned commands should be run from within
this directory.

First you need to add Pytis Python libraries somewhere to your Python path.
The recommended approach is to link the library to your site packages
directory.  On a typical unix/linux system this can be:

 $ ln -s `pwd`/lib/pytis /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/pytis

Replace `python2.3' with the Python version you use.

Alternatively, you may add Pytis to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

 $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/lib

Note, that the recommended symlinked configuration is good when you checked
Pytis out of CVS.  In this case you can check out a newer version at any time
and no further effort is needed to start using it.
