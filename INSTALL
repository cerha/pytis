Pytis Installation Instructions

Requirements:

  * Python 2.6 or later
  * PostgreSQL 8.4 or later
  * Python modules: 
    - psycopg2
    - sqlalchemy
    - imaging (only when using Image data types)  
  * For running GUI applications, you need also these Python modules:
    - wxgtk2.8 (only for GUI apps)
    - wxversion
    - webkit
    - magic
  Typical Pytis application (such as Pytis Demo) also need:
    - PostgreSQL extensions, such as ltree (postgresql-contrib)
    - PL/Python procedural language (postgresql-plpython)

Install all these on a Debian-based system:

apt-get install python postgresql python-psycopg2 python-sqlalchemy \
 python-imaging python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxversion python-magic \
 postgresql-contrib postgresql-plpython

The currently supported model of using Pytis is running it directly out of the
checked out tree, being able to check out a newer version at any time and using
this new version right away.  You need to run 'make' after each checkout to
update the generated files from the source files, but no actual installation is
needed.  Pytis is a pure Python library so you just need to setup your
PYTHONPATH and you are all done.
